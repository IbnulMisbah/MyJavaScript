# My JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! Here, I'll be documenting my progress as I learn and develop various concepts in JavaScript. Each folder will contain programs and notes on a specific topic that I'm learning, and I'll be pushing updates as I progress.

   - Iterating over Arrays and Objects

### 4. **Functions in JavaScript**
   - Function Declarations and Expressions
   - Arrow Functions
   - Callback Functions
   - Higher-Order Functions

   - Modules (import/export)
   - Default Parameters and Spread Operator

### 8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and Objects
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
   - Encapsulation

### 9. **Modern JavaScript Frameworks**

   - State Management in React (using Context API or Redux)

### 10. **Building Web Applications**
   - Working with Databases (MongoDB, Firebase)
   - Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
   - CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - RESTful APIs and HTTP Methods
   - Version Control with Git and GitHub

### 11. **Advanced Topics**
   - Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
   - Service Workers and Caching
   - WebSockets for Real-time Communication
   - Mobile App Development with React Native
   - Testing JavaScript (Jest, Mocha)
   - Web Performance Optimization (Lazy Loading, Code Splitting)
   - GraphQL Basics

## ðŸš€ My Goals
By the end of this repository, I want to be comfortable working with JavaScript for both web and mobile application development. I will build practical applications and push them to this repository to demonstrate my skills.
